# feuilleTD.sty
A LaTeX style file to create exercises sheets


You can customize the decoration in the margin to suit your needs. Open
the style file to see the name of the decorations.

You can set the decoration on odd pages with the key "margei" and on
even pages with the key "margep".

If you want a mirror effect on the decorations of the odd pages, use the
"miroiri" key ("miroirp" for even pages).

If you create a new decoration, please send it to me so we can share it
with other users.
